Blib – Privacy Policy
=====================

This is Blib’s privacy policy where we state how Blib collects data and how it is stored and used. If you 
have any questions, please visit our FAQ page and email us at blib@compgeom.com. 

**Information collected at Registration:** The information that is collected at the time of registration 
includes – user’s name, and an email address. Some of the information, for example, the user’s name, 
will be public. 

**Location Information:** We do not ask users to give us their location, and that information is kept private.

**Information Sharing:** We do not share the user’s information except in emergencies or in response to 
valid legal process. If these emergencies are to arise, then there are two separate policies; one for those 
who use Blib’s system, and one for those who use their own:

* For those who use Blib’s system, all of their information that has been stored can be sent.

* For those who use their own cloud, the only information that can be sent is the information Blib 
receives and stores at their time of registration. This information includes – user’s name, email address, Blib URL, and web key. 

**Information Security:** Blib restricts access to the user's personal information to workers and third parties unless under
specific circumstances stated in 'Information Sharing'. Blib also makes sure there is no unauthorized access to the information. 

**Personal Information Modification:** Blib allows for the user to change their personal account 
information by going to their account settings. The user also has the option of deleting their account 
from the system, in which their Blib URL will no longer exist and neither will the account. The user can 
choose to recreate their account whenever they want. 

**Log Data:** Blib does have a log which keeps track of when the user logs in, how much time they spent on 
Blib, and when they log out. However, Blib does not keep a log of what the user is doing on the website. 
The only thing Blib keeps log of is the amount of time spent on the site. 

**Third Party Data:** Blib is connected to Google in such that you need a Google account. The only 
information extracted from the user’s Google account is their name and email address. 

**Business Transfers:** If Blib were to go bankrupt and assets were to be sold to a buyer, all information 

stored would be sold to the new owners of Blib. 

**Age Policy:** Blib does not have an age restriction and this information is not collected from the user.

**Policy Changes:** These policies are subject to be revised over time. When the revisions will be effective, 

we will update the policy and notify the users. 

**Effective:** August 2nd, 2013
